In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

Second, using those sets of data, classifier construct decision trees. Decision tree predicts the results by answering some questions related to datasets. For example, model makes questions such as \"Is this student male?\", \"Is he older than 17?\" and classify each student. Finally, in evaluation step, one student would be predicted by those decision trees, and it would be classified to the most frequently predicted label."
